# EthicsEngine

*A community-driven platform for exploring ethical reasoning in AI through interactive, multi-agent simulations.*

---

## Overview

**EthicsEngine** is a lightweight web-based simulator designed to let users experiment with ethical reasoning across different agent groups ("crickets"). By securely running simulations with personal OpenAI API keys, participants actively contribute to the creation of **CricketBench**, an open dataset evaluating ethical decision-making in AI.

I'm actively seeking collaborators to help build and refine EthicsEngine into an impactful, accessible tool for the broader AI community.

## How EthicsEngine Works

1. **Choose an Ethical Scenario**
   - Select clearly structured dilemmas to test ethical reasoning.

2. **Pick a Cricket Group**
   - Each group embodies a distinct ethical perspective, such as Utilitarian, Deontological, or Fairness-based reasoning.

3. **Run a Secure Simulation**
   - Securely input your own OpenAI API key on our AWS-hosted site.
   - Watch AG2’s ReasoningAgent produce reasoning paths live.

4. **Review and Learn**
   - See reasoning outcomes instantly and understand how ethics shape decisions.

5. **Contribute to CricketBench**
   - Anonymized outcomes directly enrich our public benchmark for ethical AI evaluation.

---

## Security & Privacy

- OpenAI API keys are securely transmitted via HTTPS and **never stored or logged**.
- Only anonymized reasoning data is collected for benchmarking.

---

## Why EthicsEngine?

EthicsEngine aims to:

- Provide practical insights into ethical decision-making processes.
- Engage the community directly in building a valuable ethical reasoning dataset.
- Encourage responsible AI development through transparent benchmarking.

---

## Gamification & Community Engagement

- Earn points by contributing scenarios and participating in simulations.
- Compete and collaborate on community leaderboards.
- Help shape the future of ethical AI standards.

---

## Technical Stack (AWS-based)

- Frontend: AWS S3 & CloudFront (secure, low-cost)
- Backend: AWS Lambda & API Gateway (secure, serverless execution)
- Data Storage: AWS DynamoDB (secure anonymized data storage)

---

## Getting Started (Coming Soon!)

- Visit the EthicsEngine website (URL pending).
- Choose your scenario and cricket group.
- Enter your OpenAI API key securely and run your simulation.

## Call for Collaborators

I'm currently looking for:

- **Scenario Creators** to design clear and compelling ethical dilemmas.
- **Developers and Researchers** familiar with AI reasoning, AutoGen, and AG2 integrations.
- **Community Contributors** to assist with platform growth, moderation, and engagement.

If you're interested in helping EthicsEngine become a reality, please reach out!
